## Compatible Logstash Versions

Log Courier is compatible with most Logstash versions with a single exception.

* `>=7.4.0` and `<7.6.0` use a version of JRuby that has a bug making it incompatible
  and causes log-courier events to stop processing after an indeterminable amount
  of time (see #370) - please upgrade to 7.6.0 which updates JRuby to a compatible
  version.


## Upgrading to 2.x

There are many breaking changes in the configuration between 1.8 and 2.x. Please
check carefully the list of breaking changes here:
[Change Log](CHANGELOG.md#200).

Packages also now default to using a `log-courier` user. If you require the old
behaviour of `root`, please be sure to modify the `/etc/sysconfig/log-courier`
(CentOS/RedHat) or `/etc/default/log-courier` (Ubuntu) file.

## Features

* [Logstash Integration](docs/LogstashIntegration.md)
* Read from a file or the program input (`stdin`)
* Follow log file rotations and movements
* Compliment log events with [extra fields](docs/Configuration.md#fields)
* [Reload configuration](docs/Configuration.md#reloading) without restarting
* Transmit securely using TLS with server and (optionally) client verification
* Monitor shipping speed and status with the
[Administration utility](docs/AdministrationUtility.md)
* Pre-process events on the sender using codecs
(e.g. [Multiline](docs/codecs/Multiline.md), [Filter](docs/codecs/Filter.md))

## Philosophy

* At-least-once delivery of events to the Logstash pipeline - a Log Courier
crash should never lose events
* Be efficient, reliable and scalable
* Keep resource usage low
* Be easy to use
